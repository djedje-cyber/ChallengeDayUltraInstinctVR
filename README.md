# ChallengeDayUltraInstinctVR

## Welcome !
Hello dear Challenger ! 

In this challenge, you will experience a new way of doing software testing for  virtual reality applications I will explain each steps to perform the challenge, don't worry.

Before explaining steps to solve the challenge, I will  make some reminder to the younger of ourselves.

## Some words about software testing?

### What is software testing?
Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it's supposed to do. The benefits of good testing include preventing bugs and improving performance.

## Why do we test? 

This approach ensures that only quality products are distributed to consumers, which in turn elevates customer satisfaction and trust.

### In simple words
It's a way of veryfing that you're coding well, that you don't let bugs when software is in production and avoid the loss of companies's money or even worse life if you work in medical sector, aviation,...,...

Big reminder : Software testing proof the presence of bugs in a software but doesn't proof the absence of it !

But it's the most effective and simple way of veryfing software !
