# ChallengeDayUltraInstinctVR

## Welcome!

Hello dear Challenger!  

In this challenge, you will experience a new way of performing software testing for virtual reality applications.  
I will explain each step needed to complete the challenge — don't worry!

Before diving into the steps to solve the challenge, let's have a little reminder for our younger selves.

## Some Words About Software Testing

### What Is Software Testing?

Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it's supposed to do.  
The benefits of good testing include preventing bugs and improving performance.

### Why Do We Test?

Testing ensures that only quality products are delivered to consumers, which in turn increases customer satisfaction and trust.

### In Simple Words

It's a way to verify that you're coding correctly — making sure no bugs slip into production and helping avoid financial loss or, in critical industries like healthcare or aviation, potentially saving lives.  

> **Big Reminder**:  
> Software testing **proves the presence of bugs**, but **not the absence** of them!  

Still, it's the most effective and straightforward method to verify software quality.

## Content of the Challenge

In this challenge, you will find two folders:  

- The first one, **UltraInstinctVR**, contains the testing framework you’ll need to complete the task.
- The second one **vertexformd3d-unity-vr-starkit-main** contains the application that you have to test.
- Please LOAD the **GAMES** scene in Assets/Scenes/Vertex Form 3D Scenes/Database Scenes/Hubs  
- Everything is explained in the README file inside the folder — how it works, setup instructions, etc.
